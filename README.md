# Lobby cmd | Pocketmine-MP 2.0.0 | MCPE v0.14 - 0.15.10
 A plugin for the __/lobby__ and __/hub__ commands. These commands teleport players to the server's default world.


__These two commands shown above have the same behavior:__ in addition to teleporting players to the default world, they change the player's game mode to adventure and also clear the player's entire inventory.
